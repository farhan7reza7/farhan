Therefore, as a way of bringing to a conclusion the religious predominance of the Jews, God caused their last prophet to be born in a miraculous manner and gave him some additional miracles to perform. The Jews, however, persisted in rejecting him, and this finally proved that they did not deserve to be a community into which prophets should be born. This was a very critical moment for the Messiah’s mother, Mary. In these circumstances, she was in dire need of a corner where she could live away from the eyes of the people, and where the necessities of life should be available in a calm and peaceful atmosphere.

He feels that if he keeps quiet, will be encouraged and they will be emboldened to engage in further opposition. But all such thoughts are instigations of Satan. At this critical juncture, Satan confuses the issue with a view to leading man astray. On such occasions, one who is a believer should seek God’s protection, will cast him into manifest error."},"23:99":{"name":"23:99","tafsir":"As soon as man dies, he is separated from the present world and reaches a point of no-return. Now, he realises that the life Hereafter, which he had hitherto ignored, was in fact the real target in life. The possessions of the pre-death period were for the purpose of earning credit towards the life Hereafter and not as ends in themselves. So, after death, he will immediately want to be sent back to this world. But this will not be possible, because in accordance with the creation plan of God, every man is given only one chance. In the present world man relies on his friends and relatives, but on Judgement Day he will be all alone. There, only his good deeds will be of avail. Nothing else will save him."}},"version":{"author_name":"Maulana Wahid Uddin Khan","id":817,"language_name":"english","tafsir_name":"Tazkirul Quran(Maulana Wahiduddin Khan)","key":"en-tazkirul-quran","iso":"en"},"surahNumber":23}
