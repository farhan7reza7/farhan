He will resurrect man after his death and take the reckoning of all his deeds. It is the period of respite (during which man is put to the test) which acts as a ‘wedge’ between man and the aforesaid event. As soon as the period of trial is over, he will face the consequences—from which he seems to be far away today."},"86:10":{"name":"86:10","tafsir":"It is quite evident that there is planning in the creation of man and the world.
