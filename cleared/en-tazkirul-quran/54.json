Undoubtedly, there is a lesson to be learned from such events. But this is possible only when a man applies his mind to it.

The result was that they were afflicted by the retribution of God. This punishment came upon them in the shape of a terrible flood. The entire people and their dwellings were submerged in it. But, Noah and his companions, as commanded by God, boarded an ark. This vessel sailed forth and stopped at Mount Judi in the Mount Ararat range. Ararat is in Turkey. The highest mountain of the region, it rises to 16,\n853\nft. Certain aeroplane pilots claim that, while flying over the snow-covered Ararat peak, they have seen some boat-like thing caught up in the snow there. If this is correct, then just as the dead body of Pharaoh (of Moses’s period) was extracted from its pyramid in the late nineteenth century and became a sign of God (\n10:92\n), similarly perhaps Noah’s ark may be discovered and become a sign of God for mankind."}},"version":{"author_name":"Maulana Wahid Uddin Khan","id":817,"language_name":"english","tafsir_name":"Tazkirul Quran(Maulana Wahiduddin Khan)","key":"en-tazkirul-quran","iso":"en"},"surahNumber":54}
